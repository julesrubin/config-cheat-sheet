# Config Cheat Sheet ðŸ§ 

A personal mental cheat sheet for my messy brain that forgets how to do basic things with my computer every time.

## What's This?

This repository serves as my external brain for all those configuration tasks, setup scripts, and commands that I inevitably forget between projects. Instead of googling the same things over and over, I'm documenting them here for future me (and maybe future you).

## Repository Structure

- **`github-config/`** - Scripts and guides for GitHub repository setup and configuration
- **`pc-config/`** - General computer configuration guides and scripts

## Why This Exists

Because I'm tired of:
- Forgetting how to set up SSH keys for the nth time
- Re-googling the same git commands
- Starting from scratch every time I need to configure something
- Having my configuration knowledge scattered across random text files

## Usage

Each folder contains specific guides and scripts for different configuration tasks. Check the individual README files in each directory for detailed instructions.

Feel free to use these scripts and guides if they're helpful to you, but remember they're primarily tailored to my specific setup and preferences.

## Contributing

This is primarily a personal reference, but if you spot errors or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or PR.
